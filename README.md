# Platform-Game
This is my first videogame created using PhaserJS for learning JavaScript and its importance nowadays.

## Description
This game is a platform game created using the PhaserJS game engine. I decided to create a simple but satisfatory project to learn the use of JavaScript language in a more real context.
Some of the resources were downloaded from free pixelart pages such as [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org).

The game consists of collecting all the coins scattered throughout the map to unlock the badge for completing the level.

## How to install it?
Don't worry too much, you just need to clone this repository.

``` gitbash
https://github.com/Maxrealms2002/Platform-Game.git
```

Or if you prefer it, you can also give it a try directly on this link:
